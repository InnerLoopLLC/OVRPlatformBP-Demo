# OVRPlatformBP-Demo
An example project demonstrating the usage of the OVR Platform BP plugin for Unreal Engine 4.

This project will only be functional if you're an authorized user for the app.<br>
If you'd like to test this project directly, please contact me on <a href="https://discord.gg/AxxpQ8h">Discord</a> with your Oculus email address.<br>
I'll add you to the authorized users, which will enable the plugin to function.<br><br>
Otherwise, you will need to create your own app in the Oculus developer site, and configure all the achievements, leaderboards, etc.<br>
